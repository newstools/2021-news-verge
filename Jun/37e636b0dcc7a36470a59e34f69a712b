The United States, Canada, Ireland, UK and the European Union have expressed their concern over the Federal Government twitter ban announced by Minister Lai Mohammed. In a statement made available to NEWSVERGE, the countries convey what they described as disappointment ”over the Government of Nigeria’s announcement suspending #Twitter and proposing registration requirements for other social media”. ”We strongly support the fundamental human right of free expression and access to information as a pillar of democracy in Nigeria as around the world and these rights apply online as well as offline. Banning systems of expression is not the answer”,the statement added. The countries pointed out that ”these measures inhibit access to information and commerce at precisely the moment when Nigeria needs to foster inclusive dialogue and expression of opinions, as well as share vital information in this time of the COVID-19 pandemic”, harping that ”the path to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less, communication to accompany the concerted efforts of Nigeria’s citizens in fulsome dialogue toward unity, peace and prosperity. As Nigeria’s partners, we stand ready to assist in achieving these goals.”
