Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State on Wednesday inaugurated free eye surgery for 2,800 people in Kano, sponsored by King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre.  The governor said at the inauguration that healthcare delivery was part of his administration’s cardinal thrust as captured in the state’s 2021 budget. According to him, rendering humanitarian services, especially free eye surgery, has been considered as a gesture worth taking into cognisance by this administration. Ganduje, who was  represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Usman Alhaji, explained that the effort by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre in collaboration with Albasar Foundation, had positively impacted the lives of the less-privileged. The governor added that the issue of medical tourism in the area of eye cure was not necessary  as one needed not to travel for such purpose. He affirmed that with the services rendered by the King Salman Centre and the Albasar Foundation in the state, eye problems could be treated locally. The Commissioner for Health, Dr Aminu Tsanyawa, said the government had earlier signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Albasar Foundation to treat patients with eye problems.
