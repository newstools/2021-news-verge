Gov. Godwin Obaseki of Edo, says his administration has commenced the digitalised registration of all civil servants across the 18 Local Government Areas of the state.  Obaseki stated this on Friday while addressing members of the Edo State Civil Service Commission, led by the Chairman, Mrs Ekiuwa Inneh, who were on a courtesy visit to Edo Government House in Benin. According to Obaseki, “we have sent Information and Communications Technology (ICT) experts to scan documents of all civil servants in the state into a digital format. We have started the process of digitally registering every staff in public and civil service in Edo. “This is to have a unique e-identity stored digitally for easy identification. But beyond the account for people, we want to now account for their productivity in their various work places. “You find out that of the current staff we have in the civil service, many of them are professionals providing services to the public service. The implication of this is that we are going to use technology to drive the public service in years to come. “We won the last election because of the hope that government will deliver services to the people, our priority as government is for us to deliver good services to the people. “I don’t see any politician going back to campaign to the people of Esan in Edo without evidence to show that you have made provision for water to the people, the civil service just have to deliver good services to the public,” he said. The governor assured that his administration will move the state civil and public services to that stage where it’s an employer of choice. In her remarks, Inneh assured the governor that the commission will contribute its quota to transform the state public and civil services. “I want to assure you that we will key into your transformation agenda of the civil service because you have recognised that the civil service has to be empowered,” she said.
