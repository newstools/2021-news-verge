Following a temporary downtime in the check-in system of Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Ikeja, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) on Friday appealed to airlines and passengers to be patient and understanding.  The General Manager, Corporate Affairs of FAAN, Mrs Henrietta Yakubu, made the appeal in a statement in Lagos. Yakubu said that FAAN had already mobilised necessary resources to address the challenge. “All hands are on deck to restore normalcy in passenger facilitation. “To avoid flight delays, the authority advises passengers to leave their homes early so as to complete all check-in formalities in good time,” she said.
