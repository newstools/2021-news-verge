Gatefield, A Non Government Organisation (NGO) on Thursday appealed to the Federal Government to reverse its decision over ban on Twitter in the country.  Mrs Adewunmi Emoruwa, Lead Strategist, Gatefield, made the appeal in a statement on Thursday in Abuja. Emoruwa said Gatefield being an international public strategy and communications firm saw governments decision to ban Twitter as ill-timed because of the importance of the medium at this particular period in the country. She said that different categories of Nigerians are using Twitter for different purposes including business, education among others.. She said that banning of Twitter would jeopardise millions of naira invested by individual and organisation through usage of social media platform. “Several Nigerian individuals and entities in the digital communications sector have already had contracts with global organisations that they serve terminated. “Mr President, our country needs more revenue and more opportunities. The citizens need jobs. This decision robs us of these opportunities. “We play by the rules. Since no Nigerian law criminalises the use of any social media platform for expression, communications, and business, we will continue to use the Twitter platform to get our work done. “We understand the consequences of telling the truth. But, unfortunately, the cost of indifference is much more than we can afford to bear,” she said.
