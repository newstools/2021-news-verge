The Chairman, House Committee on Finance, Rep James Faleke, gave the directive at an investigative hearing into alleged 30 billion dollars annual revenue leakage on Tuesday, in Abuja.

He also stated that the agency must provide the identity of the person it loaned money to, adding that the committee needed the approval letter from the Accountant General’s office. Faleke stated that on no account shall any withdrawal be made from the revenue account, stressing that a peep into the constitution would provide a better understanding. The lawmaker also demanded explanation on conflicting figures in the consumption of fuel in the country. He added that NNPC was earlier quoted to have said that daily consumption of fuel was 93 million litres, while PPPRA had also said that daily consumption of fuel was 80 million litres per day.
