Both actresses have over time taken to social media to openly condemn the conduct of one of them, Omiyinka Olanrewaju, also known as Baba Ijesha, who was accused of defiling the foster daughter of comedienne, Princess. Iyabo and Nkechi at several time clashed with some members of the association who kicked against them openly condemning Baba Ijesha. Speaking on behalf of member Board of Trustee of the association at a press briefing on Sunday, veteran actor, Jide Kosoko said despite the fact that Iyabo Ojo and Nkechi Blessing are not registered members of TAMPAN, the association would not entertain any form of disrespect by both actresses who tried to drag the association in the mud. Kosoko stressed that the association is aware of the derogatory statements made by Iyabo Ojo against the Association and the industry as a whole, noting that they will not take further insults. He noted that indeed both actresses are not members of the association but that they can frustrate them out of the industry if they continue to constitute a ‘nuisance’ on social media.
