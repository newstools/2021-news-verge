Gov. Dave Umahi of Ebonyi has urged the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) to give approval for the commencement of academic activities in Ebonyi Medical University, Uburu.  The governor’s request is contained in a statement signed by Mr Francis Nweze, his Special Assistant on Media, and made available to newsmen in Abakaliki on Friday. Nweze stated that Umahi made the request when he paid a courtesy visit to the JAMB Registrar,  Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, on Thursday in Abuja. The governor said the institution had met JAMB’s preliminary requirements. He, therefore, appealed to the board to approve the university for placement for prospective medical students in the next admission year. Umahi said the institution was one of the best in the West African subregion with sufficient accommodation for students and lecturers. According to him, the institution is a centre of excellence in eye treatment, kidney transplant, surgical section and production of dialyzers, among others. He said the university had the capacity to check medical tourism in Nigeria, considering its sophistication and installed state-of-the-art medical equipment. The statement read in part: “Of course, we have Dialysis Centre, Oxygen Production Centre and so many other centres. “Interestingly, there is something we never had in Africa that we are going to have there and that is the production of dialyzers. “Dialyzers are disposable for the treatment of kidney dialysis and we have made over 80 per cent commitment in terms of equipment. “So, we are going to be producing these dialyzers. No hospital, no place in West Africa is producing it. “This is going to assist the state very well,” the governor said, hoping that in the next three years, the centre should begin to contribute meaningfully to the state coffers. The statement further stated that the registrar assured Umahi of the boards support to ensure the successful take-off of the institution in record time.
