Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State on Friday praised the late Governor of Oyo State, Abiola Ajimobi, for the legacy he left behind, one year after his demise.  Akeredolu spoke with newsmen in Ibadan at the one-year memorial fidaus (Islamic prayers) for the late governor. The governor, who was represented by his deputy, Mr Lucky Aiyedatiwa, said that Ondo State was present at the event not just to remember the dead, but to celebrate the good name he left behind. Akeredolu said that the legacy and good deeds the former deputy national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) would not be only missed in Ondo State but across the country. “This is one of the ways we can solidarise with the family of Sen. Ajimobi. “It is a way of remembering not just the dead, as it were, but the good name that he left behind. “We also remember his good works in Oyo State and the nation,” he said. One of the officiating ministers, Sheikh Muhyideen Bello, also known as Oniwaasi Agbaye, urged those still alive to lead a life worthy of commendation.
