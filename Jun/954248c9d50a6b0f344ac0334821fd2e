The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has appealed to airlines, passengers and all other stakeholders at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, to bear with the authority on facilities challenges.  Mrs Henrietta Yakubu, the General Manager, Corporate Affairs of FAAN, said this in a statement issued on Thursday in Lagos. Yakubu said some facilities at the airport were functioning below capacity due to system upgrade challenges, thereby slowing the pace of passenger facilitation. According to Yakubu, the authority is doing everything possible to commission the brand new international terminal in Lagos as soon as possible to reduce the stress on our customers. “We are also working assiduously to ensure that the aged equipment or facilities at the old terminal are maintained in optimal working conditions.”
