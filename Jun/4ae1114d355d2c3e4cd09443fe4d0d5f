He said the exercise has recorded a great turnout. ”We registered 1.2 million between December 2012 and May 2021. ”The number ought to be much  higher  than what was recorded  considering the population size of the state,” he said. He called on those who are yet to register and obtain their NIN, todo so. Abdulmumin appealed for more funds and additional functional enrolment machines and relevant  gadgets to enable the office function and perform optimally. ”We have registration centres in 15 local government areas. NIMC staff members are working daily achieve wider and effective coverage,” he said.

By this act, he said electricity has been restored in the state NIMC office. It was reported that on May 4, the federal government approved the extension of the deadline for the NIN exercise to June 30.
