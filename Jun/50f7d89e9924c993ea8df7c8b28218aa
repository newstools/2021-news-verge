Johanna Konta has withdrawn from Wimbledon after being classified as a close contact of a positive test for COVID-19, the tennis event’s organisers announced on Sunday.  A member of the British number one’s team showed COVID symptoms and a PCR test returned a positive result. Konta will now be required to spend 10 days in self-isolation and will be replaced in the Wimbledon women singles draw by lucky loser Yafan Wang of China.
