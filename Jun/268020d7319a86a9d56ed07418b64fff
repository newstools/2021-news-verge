The United States has condemned the banning of twitter in Nigeria, saying the country’s constitution provides for freedom of expression. In a statement made available to NEWSVERGE, it says that ”Government’s recent #Twitterban undermines Nigerians’ ability to exercise this fundamental freedom and sends a poor message to its citizens, investors and businesses. It added that banning social media and curbing every citizen’s ability to seek, receive, and impart information undermines fundamental freedoms. ”As President Biden has stated, our need for individual expression, open public conversation, and accountability has never been greater.  The path to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less communication, alongside concerted efforts toward unity, peace, and prosperity”, the statement added.
