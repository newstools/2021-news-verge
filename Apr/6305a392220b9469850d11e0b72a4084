An IT expert, Sir Demola Aladekomo, says the ongoing registration for the National Identity Number (NIN) will boost identification infrastructure in the country once completed.  Aladekomo, who is the chairman of a Lagos-based computer firm, CHAMS Plc, noted that the process would enable access and means to confirm the identity of citizens within the country. “In most countries in Africa like Nigeria, lack of strong foundational identity systems has often led to the proliferation of disconnected functional registers. “According to a study carried out by the World Bank, the ability to prove one’s identity is a cornerstone of participation in modern life, yet over 1.5 billion people lack proof of legal identity. “Many are currently faced with the challenge of reverse-engineering civil registers and national IDs in order to improve efficiency and meet the demand for identification services,” the IT expert said in a statement in Lagos on Friday. Aladekomo noted that he would be speaking on “Socio-Economic Imperative of National Identity Management” at the University of Lagos on Thursday. According to him, the programme holding via Zoom with meeting ID 82815951731 will be moderated by Prof. Lere Baale, Chief Executive of Business School Netherlands (BSN) in Nigeria. He explained that his presentation would touch on areas such as financial services, identity management, security, political stability and evolution among others.
