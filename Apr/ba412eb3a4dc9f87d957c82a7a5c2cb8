Imam Marooph Raji, the Chief Imam of Nasrul-lahi-li Fathi Society of Nigeria (NASFAT), has urged Muslims to embrace and practice the teachings of the Holy Qur’an for peace, stability and progress to reign in the country.  The Imam made the call during the commencement of the 2021 Annual Ramadan Tafsir on Sunday in Kaduna. The cleric attributed the challenges of corruption and insecurity confronting the nation to the disobedience of Allah’s injunctions. He therefore urged Muslims to use the Ramadan period for self restraint, service to humanity and in seeking for Allah’s forgiveness. Raji prayed for peace and stability in the country, and for all Nigerians to return to God in all their dealings. The Imam noted that in spite of Allah’s blessings on Nigeria, the people have continued to transgress, adding that the only way out was to embrace the teachings of the Holy Qu’ran. Declaring the Tafsir open, a member of NASFAT board, Mallam Luqman Salati, said Muslims should be grateful and themselves to the worship of Allah during the month of Ramadan. He said they should be thankful for witnessing another Tafsir because last year, it didn’t hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Salati advised all Muslims to use the Quran to resolve their life challenges, “because evey challenge has a solution in the Quran.” In his remark, Chairman, NASFAT Ramadan Committee, Abdulwaheed Amusa, said the 2021 fast came at a critical time, as the nation grapples with security and other challenges. He  said that it was time that Nigerians focus on Allah for peace, prosperity and unity to reign in the country. It was reported that NASFAT has over one million members in Nigeria.
