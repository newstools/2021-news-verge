President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the appointment of Deputy Inspector-General of Police (I-G) Usman Baba as Acting Inspector-General of Police with immediate effect.  Minister of Police Affairs Maigari Dingyadi confirmed the appointment when he addressed State House correspondents in Abuja on Tuesday. Baba will replace Mohammed Adamu who was appointed on Jan. 15, 2019 to replace Mr Ibrahim Idris. Adamu’s tenure ended in February but Buhari had, on Feb. 4, extended his tenure as the Inspector-General of Police for three months. Adamu has, however, spent two months and three days. The incoming I-G Baba was promoted to the rank of DIG in December 2020 and was in charge of the Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID). He holds a masters degree in Public Administration and a B.A (Ed.) degree in Political Science. A fellow of the National Defence College and a member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Baba attended several professional courses/workshops. Baba, a Yobe-born police officer, had held several strategic positions in the Nigeria Police. He had served as the Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) in charge of Zone-5, Benin, Zone-4 Makurdi and Zone-7, Abuja. The acting I-G had served as the Commissioner of Police in charge of the Federal Capital Territory and Delta. He had also served as the Acting DIG in charge of the Force Finance and Administration as well as the Force Secretary.
