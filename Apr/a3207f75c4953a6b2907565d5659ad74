As the security situation in Nigeria continued to grow worse, the lawmaker representing Kogi West senatorial district, Senator Smart Adeyemi, weep on the floor of the House saying Nigeria is on fire! Adeyemi, during the plenary session contributing to a motion on insecurity on Tuesday, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to seek international support to quell the rising insecurity in the country.    “This is the worst instability we are facing; in fact, this is worse than the civil war. We cannot pretend that we are capable of confronting the situation in our hand,” an emotional Adeyemi lamented as he addressed his colleagues present at the plenary. He added, “The nation is on fire, the President must rise to the occasion. We cannot keep quiet any longer. “It has gotten to a point that we cannot sleep with our two eyes closed. Our children are not free.” Senator Smart Adeyemi, however, acknowledged that he remained a supporter of President Muhammadu Buhari, as a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), but insisted that the President must be told the truth. The lawmaker joined the calls for the Muhammadu Buhari administration to seek help in addressing the security challenges in the country.
