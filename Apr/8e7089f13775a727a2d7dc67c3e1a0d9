U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday urged Congress to approve a police reform that would address the issue of racially motivated brutality.  Biden said in his speech before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday evening said “let’s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death. The country supports this reform. Congress should act.’’ Floyd, an African American resident of Minneapolis, died in police custody last May, however, earlier this month former police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of murder in the Floyd case. The police reform bears Chauvin’s name and has already been passed by the House of Representatives, but faces an uphill battle in the Senate. Biden called on Democrats and Republicans to find common ground. “I know the Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in productive discussions with Democrats. We need to work together to find a consensus.’’
