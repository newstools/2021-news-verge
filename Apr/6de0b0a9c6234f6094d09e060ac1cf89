The House of Representatives has reassured that it would put in place mechanism to end incessant doctors’ strike in Nigeria.  Speaker Femi Gbajabiamika said this when he met with the Ministers of Health and Finance, the Accountant General of the Federation and members of Nigeria Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) on Thursday in Abuja. Gbajabiamila expressed gratitude for the tireless efforts of all stakeholders to ensure that NARD suspended its strike. He said that it was necessary to know the status of the suspended strike in term of understanding between NARD and the Federal Government. He added that there was need to ensure that agreement reached before the strike was suspended on the part of the government was implemented. The speaker said that the National Assembly must know what it could do to ensure that the demands of NARD were met. “My concern and that of Nigerians is the consequences that will follow if we do not fulfil our part as government,” he said. Rep. Tanko Sununu, the House Chairman of Healthcare Service said that following several pleas and negotiations the  Resident Doctors decided to suspend their strike. He said that the meeting became necessary in order to inform relevant organs on the development and the promise made for NARD to suspend the strike. It was reported that NARD on April 10 suspended its strike that lasted for 10 day. The National President of the Association, Dr Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi said the strike was suspended due to the association’s responsibility to Nigerians and the fact that the government has met some of the demands of the Budget Office among others.
