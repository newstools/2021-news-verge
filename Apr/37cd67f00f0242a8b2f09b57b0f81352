Describing Bose, Billboard wrote: “Amid the pandemic, Ogulu co-executive-produced, released and promoted the “Twice As Tall” album from Nigeria’s breakout global star Burna Boy (aka Damini Ogulu). He is signed to Bad Habit/Atlantic in the United States and Warner Music International for territories outside of Africa. Twice As Tall won best global music album at this year’s Grammy Awards. Bose has set up a publishing company through Spaceship Collective to enable Africans to own their own catalogues “so that the authenticity of our stories, our glory, our culture is sustained,” she says, “and we are empowered.” In her response to the recognition on her social media platform, Bose said, “Honored to have made it to Billboard’s 2021 international power player list.
