Chief Ekene Enefe, a chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra, says the party is working assiduously to ensure it emerge victorious at the Nov. 6 governorship election.  Enefe spoke on Friday at a grassroots mobilisation campaign in Ogbunike Ward 1 and Ward 2 in Oyi Local Government Area (LGA) of the state. The chieftain, also the party leader in the area, commended APC members for their massive turnout during membership registration/validation exercise of the party. He said that it was an indication that they desired change. Enefe, however, called on the party to conduct a credible and acceptable primary election. “Oyi and Ogbunike in particular are supposed to be one of the most developed communities in Anambra but we are disappointed with the APGA government. “We are ready to support our party, the APC, to win the Nov. 6 election and that is why we are mobilising strongly. “Our only appeal is that the leadership of APC should allow the candidate that will emerge to be a true reflection of the wishes of the people, a free and fair primaries will increase our chance by 50 per cent,” he said. Mr Benjamin Ezeako, an official of APC in Oyi LGA expressed delight that the party was gaining ground in the area. “We have been supporting the party in government in Anambra but we are ashamed with what we have as dividends of democracy. “That is why we are throwing our weight behind APC because it is the party that will rule the state in 2022. “We don’t want APGA anymore even though the first lady is our sister, we are calling on the entire Anambra people to support APC for better governance in the state,” he said.
