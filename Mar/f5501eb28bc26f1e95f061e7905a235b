Rafael Nadal will not compete at next week’s ATP 500 event in Dubai as he has not recovered fully from a back issue sustained ahead of the Australian Open, the world No.2 said on Thursday.  Nadal struggled with the problem in the build-up to the year’s first Grand Slam and skipped Spain’s ATP Cup ties, but still managed to reach the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park without dropping a set before losing to Stefanos Tsitsipas. The 34-year-old 20-time Grand Slam champion has not played since that defeat and was awarded a wild card to compete at the March 14-March 20 tournament in Dubai. “I would like to thank the @DDFTennis for the wild card invitation sent to me,” Nadal said on Twitter. “We seriously thought about coming to play, but I don’t think I am ready to play yet.” Nadal is still entered at the Miami Open, an ATP 1000 event to be held from March 24-April 4.
