Gov. Samuel Ortom of Benue has said that the Tor Tiv palace in Gboko, reconstructed at the cost of N1.6 billion, will be inaugurated on April 8.  Ortom stated this after inspecting the palace and other road projects in Gwer East, Tarka and Gboko local government areas of the state on Thursday. He said the 14 Tiv-speaking local government areas, in partnership with the state government, made substantial contributions to the reconstruction of the palace. The governor also said that Aper Aku road, Prof. Dent and Isaac Shaahu roads would be inaugurated same day. He also directed that all the governor’s lodges across the state be used as official residence of first class chiefs in their respective areas. Ortom also explained that where there were no governor’s lodges, government would build new residences for the affected chiefs. Speaking on the 36-kilometre Igbor-Ikpa-Wannue road, Ortom expressed displeasure with the quality of work done and the time wasted on the project. He said he was “highly disappointed” with the quality of work done so far on the road awarded at the cost of N2.6 billon and ordered the firm handling it, CGGC Ltd., to re-work certain areas and complete it within two weeks. Ortom said that the contract was awarded by the Gabriel Suswam-led administration in 2014. It was reported that the Tiv Traditional Council, led by Tor Tiv, Prof James Ayatse, had earlier invoked divine and ancestral powers to shield the governor from any attack and blessed him.
