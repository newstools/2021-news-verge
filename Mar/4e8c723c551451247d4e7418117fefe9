Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has said his administration would continue to encourage all public officials to discharge their duties optimally.  Akeredolu said this on Monday in Akure during the swearing-in of four new commissioners. Our correspondent reports that the state House of Assembly, last Tuesday confirmed the four commissioners-nominees. The commissioners are; Mr Donald Ojogo, Mr Charles Titiloye, Mr Wale Akinterinwa and Mr Aminu Raimi. Akeredolu, who said only those who were ready to serve would be engaged, explained that his administration would demand extreme diligence. According to him, his administration will not condone mischief and indecent acts while disloyalty will be sanctioned with dispatch. “It is in the light of this that we admonish the commissioners to avoid all distractions. “They should remain focused on the collective goal set by this administration for maximum positive impact,” he said. Responding on behalf of the commissioners, Akinterinwa thanked the governor for the honour and privilege he gave them to serve the state once again. While also thanking God, Akinterinwa promised that they would do their best to justify the confidence reposed in them. It was reported that Ojogo, Titiloye and Akinterinwa had served as commissioners, while Aminu was the special adviser on Works, Lands and Infrastructure during the first tenure of Akeredolu.
