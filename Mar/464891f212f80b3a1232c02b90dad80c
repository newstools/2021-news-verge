Alhaji Muhammed Muluku, member representing Nassarawa Eggon East constituency at the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, has commended Gov. Abdullahi Sule for the good works of his administration.  Muluku (APC) and Chief Whip of the House called on the electorate to support Sule beyond 2023, because of the governor’s developmental strides in all aspects of life. He made the remarks on Thursday in Lafia when he received Ende community from Nassarawa Eggon Local Government Area of the state. The lawmaker said giving Sule another mandate would enable the people get more democratic dividends from both the state and federal governments. He enumerated some projects that the constituents have gained from the present administration both at the federal and state levels to include Police Mobile College, development of Ende hills as a tourist resort, political appointments, school projects and primary health care. He also urged the people to speak with one voice, adding that the governor has a listening ear and will always welcome useful suggestions. Muluku advised the people of Ende and Eggon in general to respect constituted authorities and shun sentiments for the progress of the state. Besides, he called on Nigerians to live in peace and tolerate one another for development to thrive.
