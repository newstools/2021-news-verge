The FCT Minister of State, Dr Ramatu Aliyu on Thursday, called for equal future free from stigma, stereotypes and violence for women across the globe.  Aliyu made this known while addressing newsmen in Abuja. The minister said to attain a future that was sustainable, peaceful and violent-free with equal rights and opportunities for all, the world needed women at every table where decisions were being made. “When women lead, we see positive results. Some of the most efficient and exemplary responses to the COVID-19 pandemic were led by women. “Young women are at the forefront of diverse and equality in all parts of the world. Yet, women under 30 are less than one per cent of parliamentarians worldwide. “This is why this year’s International Women’s Day is a rallying cry for generational equality, to act for an equal future for all. We must progress together no matter the storm for as long as we are together, be rest assured we will overcome,” she said. Aliyu said the COVID-19 pandemic had further widened the gap of inequality that disadvantaged women had been facing, saying: “lockdown brought the livelihood of many women to an abrupt end.” On her part, Mrs Imaan Sulaiman-Ibrahim, Director-General, National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) disclosed that over 80 per cent of victims of human trafficking were women. Represented by the Director, Counseling and Rehabilitation, Ebere Veron, the NAPTIP director-general said the agency would continue to work with the FCT Social Development Secretariat in areas of rescuing and also reuniting victims of human trafficking. Also, Dr Gloria Shoda, President of the National Council of Women Society (NCWS) condemned the kidnapping of women and domestic violence. She urged women to always support women, saying that over time, women had distinguished themselves in several areas in Nigeria except in politics,  due to lack of a level playing field for them.
