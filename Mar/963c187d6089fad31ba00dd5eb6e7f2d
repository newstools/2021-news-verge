Ilorin is known for peaceful co-existence nationwide. Let us remain calm and resolute to the fact that the position of law is clear on the matter. “There is no fight between Muslims and Christians. Let us avoid religious crisis of any kind. Islam and christianity preaches peace and harmony. Let us also avoid division and enemity in our society,” the Emir urged.
