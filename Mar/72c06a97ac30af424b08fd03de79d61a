The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Jalingo Chapter has attributed the increase in pump price of petrol in the state to increase in depot charge.  IPMAN Chairman in the state, Alhaji Lukman Mohammed said this on Thursday in an interview with our reporter. Mohammed said that the situation had made it difficult for marketers in the state to comply with the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) directives not to sell petrol above N162 per litre. “The recent hike in depot charge has forced marketers to sell above the official price. “We were paying N147 per litre at the depot and selling at N162, but the depot charge has jumped up to N157.78, hence the price at the filling station cannot be stable. “Our worry is that the same DPR that is insisting on official price will not control depot charge but insists that we must not sell above the official price. “We are calling on DPR, Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and other agencies in the sector to resolve the price situation at depot,” he said. Mohammed, the Managing Director, Maihanchi Oil Nigeria Ltd., said that marketers were ready to sell petrol at the official price if the depot charge would be reviewed. It was reported that some marketers in the state were selling petrol at N170 per litre but that the DPR had warmed them against selling above the official price of N162.
