Wife of the Ondo State Governor, Mrs Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, has urged well-meaning individuals in the society to give to the needy to improve their standards of living.  Anyanwu-Akeredolu made the call on Friday in Akure at the inauguration of an 18-seater Hummer bus donated by a House of Representative member to the Breast Cancer Association of Nigeria (BRECAN), Ondo State chapter. It was reported that the bus was donated to the association by Mr Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, representing Akoko South East and South Federal Constituency. It was also reported that that the bus was inaugurated at the first Annual General Meeting of the association The governor’s wife urged other lawmakers to emulate Tunji-Ojo, saying that the bus would enable the association to move into grassroots and sensitise women on breast cancer. According to her, advocacy and awareness campaigns are very key in addressing the dreadful disease. Appreciating the gesture, Dr Oluwatoyin Ayimoro, the Chairperson of BRECAN in the state, said that it was good to impact lives and give to humanity. Ayimoro noted that if the culture of giving was imbibed by all, there would be a drastic reduction in social vices and that society would be better for all. BRECAN is a non-governmental organisation galvanising action against breast cancer in Nigeria. Founded by Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, a breast cancer survivor herself, BRECAN is increasingly improving the lives of many touched by breast cancer who would have succumbed to the disease due to ignorance and lack of support. She was inspired by the strength gained from her traumatic experience and the indifference surrounding the disease.
