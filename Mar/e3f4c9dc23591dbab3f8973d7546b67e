An unemployed man, Rasaki Oseni was on Wednesday docked before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly robbing a man of his phone by threatening him with an axe.  Oseni, 28, whose address was not provided, pleaded innocence to the charges of conspiracy and armed robbery. The Prosecutor, Insp. Emmanuel Ajayi told the court that the defendant and others still at large committed the offences on March 10 at Oke-Odo, Lagos. He said that the defendant allegedly armed with an axe robbed one Ebenezer Abel of his phone worth N66,000. Ajayi alleged that the defendant approached Abel and threatened to cut him down with the axe should he fail to relinquish his belongings. The prosecutor said the defendant allegedly dispossessed Abel of his phone and took to his heels. He said the complainant raised alarm, passersby chased Oseni and apprehended him. Ajayi told the court that Oseni and the phone were handed over to the police. Ajayi said that the offences violate Sections 297 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The Section 297 attracts 21 years imprisonment for armed robbery while Section 411 attracts two years in jail for conspiracy. The Magistrate, Mrs A.S Odusanya gave the defendant bail in the sum of N100,000 with two sureties in like sum. Odusanya said the sureties must be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. He adjourned the case until April 22 for hearing.
