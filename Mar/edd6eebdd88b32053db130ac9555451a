Opeyemi in her petition, told the court: “I wasted a whole 28 years in an unhappy and uneventful union with my husband. “I have never had peace of mind while with him. He has turned me into his punching bag. ”He is irresponsible and does not provide for our five children. “Some of the children have dropped out of school,” Opeyemi said.
