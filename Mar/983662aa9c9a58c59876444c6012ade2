President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday ordered the service chiefs to identify the leaders of the bandits and kidnappers and take them out to restore confidence in the areas affected. The president gave the directive as a first assignment to the service chiefs and declared that he would no longer condone a situation where kidnappers set the tone. The National Security Adviser, Babagana Munguno told State House correspondents that President Buhari gave this directive to Service Chiefs at the security meeting held at the presidential villa. Monguno said the President also issued a warning to all those collaborating with criminals, promising to deal decisively with them. Also, the Service Chiefs at the security meeting disclosed that they have identified weak areas that would be strengthened to appropriately fish out collaborators with non-state actors. Monguno said further that the President is aware of plans by individuals who constitute themselves as authorities to undermine the efforts of the central government and is sending out a warning that the government would clamp down on them.
