A Kaduna State High Court, on Monday, adjourned the “secret trial“ of the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), Ibrahim El Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat, until March 31.

The lead prosecution counsel, Chris Umar, who is also the Solicitor General and Permanent Secretary, Kaduna State Ministry of Justice, confirmed this to reporters shortly after the trial that lasted from 11 a.m. to 5;15 p.m.. Umar said that the prosecution had so far presented 14 witnesses before the court. He said that the court had admitted several items in evidence, but declined to mention the items. Also, Femi Falana, Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), told reporters that items including video recordings, Dane guns, SIM cards among others were admitted in evidence by the court.
