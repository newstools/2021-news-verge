Paul Aigbogun, a former national under-20 male football team coach, has advised clubs to recruit talented players from the ongoing Nigeria National League (NNL).  Aigbogun gave the advice on Monday in Enugu while speaking with newsmen after watching the 2020/2021 NNL match between Giant Brillars FC of Enugu and Nnewi United. “There are lots of talents in the league, and the match between Giant Brillars FC and Nnewi United was interesting with good players. “It is good to watch these players from time to time because there are  lots of excitement, and lots of young and talented players are here,” he said. Aigbogun, who once coached at Enyimba International FC, assured that the players in the NNL could graduate from the lower league into Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) and the national teams. “Most of the players in NPFL played here in the NNL and that is why we have to encourage the NNL players by watching the league. “The problem is that, lots of players featured in this league but before you know it, they will travel outside the country. “So, we need to catch them young and this is where the young blood are. “I think, NPFL clubs should come and watch matches of this nature in order to recruit lots of young, energetic and talented players,” Aigbogun added. Speaking on the officiating, the coach said officiating in the league had been up to expectations except some errors. He called on the league organisers to ensure that good officiating was maintained in all matches.
