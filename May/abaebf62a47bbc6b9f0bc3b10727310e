Commenting on the week’s performance, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., Mr Ambrose Omordion, attributed the bearish mood to losses posted during the period by some blue chips. “The nation’s stock market witnessed a bearish week as a result of high capitalised stocks that seem overpriced that suffered losses on low dividend yields,” Omordion said. He added that profit taking and portfolio repositioning on the strength of first quarter numbers and economic data ahead of half year earnings report contributed to the development. On the performance of the stock market this week, Omordion said the market might witness a rebound depending on the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting slated for May 24 and 25. He, however, said the MPC members should not be in a hurry to hike rates in the midst of the rising insecurity in the country. “If the rates are retained, the market will breath out immediately, on positioning for March year end audited accounts, half year interim dividend and second quarter earnings season,” he said. According to him, the first quarter Gross Domestic Product data expected to hit the market on Monday is another factor that will determine the direction of the stock market. Also speaking, Malam Garba Kurfi, the Managing Director, APT Securities and Funds Ltd., said the downward trend last week was due to losses recorded by Airtel Africa, MTNN, Dangote Cement and BUA Cement. Kurfi told our reporter that the decision of the MPC would either enable the market to make some recovery from the previous loss or increase it, especially if rates were not retained as before.
