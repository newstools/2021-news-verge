Corps members posted to states should initiate projects that would help to develop their host communities, Dr Bolanle Solanke, an aide to Gov. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, has said.  Solanke, the Senior Special Assistant to Gov. Fayemi on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), gave the charge on Friday during an advocacy visit to the National Youth Service Corps, (NYSC), Permanent Orientation Camp, Emure-Ekiti, in Emure Local Government Area. The Senior Special Assistant, who addressed the 2021 Batch A, Stream 11 corps members, said that the objective for establishing the SDGs was to improve the quality of lives of everyone in the society. She encouraged corps members to key into the 17 SDGs and impact on the lives of members of their host communities. “I encourage corps members to come up with laudable initiatives, which will make their host communities better. “I want to assure corps members of the support of Gov. Kayode Fayemi, through the Office of the SDGs, if they can come up with programmes and projects that can impact on the lives of Ekiti people. I encourage corps members to join the SDGs Volunteer Group, when they get posted to their communities of service,” she said. Also speaking at the event, the NYSC Coordinator in Ekiti, Mrs Mary Chikezie, on behalf of the scheme’s management, thanked the SDGs team. She said that NYSC would ensure that corps members posted to Ekiti impact positively on their host communities and leave the place better than they met it.
