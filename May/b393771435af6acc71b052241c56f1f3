Former President Goodluck Jonathan has commiserated with Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), over the death of his son, Pastor Dare Adeboye.  Jonathan in a condolence message, in Abuja on Thursday, expressed sadness over the passing of the pastor, describing him as a much-loved clergyman. Jonathan noted that the late man of God lived a life that was a pattern of good works and prayed to God to grant his soul eternal rest. “My family and I condole with Pastor Enoch Adeboye and the entire membership of the RCCG, on the death of Pastor Dare Adeboye, son of the General Overseer, and a much-loved clergyman. “Though I never knew Pastor Dare personally, I have had cause to meet his father, Pastor Adeboye, and it would seem that the apple did not fall far from the tree,” he said. According to him, from every account, Pastor Dare lived a life that was a pattern of good works and a credit to the Body of Christ. “He was known to emulate the godliness and moral leadership that his father is well known for. “We share in the grief that naturally comes when such a devout man passes on to eternal glory,” he said. Jonathan prayed to God to grant the family of the deceased and the RCCG ministry the fortitude to bear the loss.
