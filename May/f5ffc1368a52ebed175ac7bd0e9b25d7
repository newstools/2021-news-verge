The Kaduna State lndependent Electoral Commission (KAD-SIECOM) has again, postponed indefinitely, the Local  Council election fixed for June 5.  Recall that the commission had earlier fixed the poll for May 16, and later shifted it to June 5. The Acting Chairman of the commission, Ibrahim Sambo, made the announcement at a meeting with leadership of political parties, media and other stakeholders, on Friday in Kaduna. The acting chairman said a new date for the poll would be announced in due course. According to him, the shift was due to non availability of sensitive materials, including batteries for the Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) being expected to be delivered by the Chinese manufacturers. He said the shipment of the EVM batteries from China to Abuja is scheduled for July 1 and July 10, 2021, after which the commission would need two weeks to charge the batteries.
