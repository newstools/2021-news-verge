The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, on Tuesday in Abuja described sports as a vital tool in promoting peace in Africa.  Amaechi, during a visit by the Organisation of Military Sports in Africa (OSMA), led by Brig.-Gen. Maikano Abdullahi, said sports should therefore be effectively utilised. “Sports is a vital tool in promoting peace within the region, so it is commendable for us to have a competition to enhance it,” he said. The minister pledged his support for the forthcoming International Military Sports in Africa proposed for Sahel Region countries, saying it is a good initiative. It was reported that the competition is to promote peace through sports. Earlier, Abdullahi had said the visit was to acquaint the minister with some facts about OSMA programmes. He said the visit was also to inform the minister about the forthcoming Sahel Region countries’ “Sports for peace” to be hosted by Nigeria in October. “The visit is also for us to solicit the ministry’s support,” Abdullahi said, describing Amaechi as a man of integrity who fosters peace. “The activities lined up for the event include football, marathon and golf. “The countries competing are Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Libya and Benin Republic,” he said.
