Analysts at United Capital Plc had anticipated that the bears would dominate transactions this week, amid Treasury Bills auction. “We expect the overall theme of the market to tilt towards the bears, considering the anticipated NTB auction scheduled to hold later in the week. “However, following profit-taking last week, we expect investors to pick up attractive stocks on the dip in the earlier trading sessions,” they said.
