The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has said that the scheme is a humane one which places premium on the security, welfare and wellbeing of corps members.  The State Coordinator, NYSC Plateau, Ms Caroline Embu, said this in a statement made available to our correspondent on Friday in Jos. Embu stated that the scheme was aware of the security challenges in the country, and that it wasn’t resting on its oars in ensuring premium security for the corps members. She, however, decried the purported petition seeking for the mass relocation of corps members from the state trending in the social media with the headline entitled “300 corps members in Plateau sign petition for relocation over killings”. According to her, the management has made it clear to the corps members who wish to relocate could do so, as it was the right of corps members to apply for relocation. The State coordinator however explained that the act of relocation was an administrative process which required all desiring corps members to apply. She said that due to “the prevailing situation, a lot of formalities were being waived and it was therefore mischievous for “corps members to allegedly petition for relocation on social media”. According to her, corps members who wish to relocate from Plateau State are encouraged to apply. “We assure you that your applications will be treated speedily,” she said. She urged the corps members to remain law abiding, security conscious and reach out to NYSC and security officials nearest to them, in the event of any security threat. She said that the NYSC was working in collaboration with the security agencies to ensure that corps members were not posted to areas with security challenges. Embu stated that the NYSC remained a tool for national unity, peace and development.
