Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State Thursday launched the construction of the 5.4-kilometre Amagunze Road in Nkanu East Local Government Area of the state.  It was reported that the road has been deplorable for many years. The project is being funded by a prominent indigene of Ishienu Amagunze, Chief Evarest Nnaji. Ugwuanyi commended Nnaji for the gesture, adding that his administration was committed to identifying with such projects. He called on other wealthy individuals in the state to support the government in the delivery of public goods to residents of the state. He said that his administration would intervene on the Agu Eduma Aniyi Bridge, linking Amagunze-Amechi Idodo-Oruku, recently destroyed by flood. In a speech, Nnaji said the project was intended to complement what the state government was doing in the rural communities.
