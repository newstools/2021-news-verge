Manchester United striker Edinson Cavani’s Uruguay call-up for next month’s 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers has been cancelled.  The Premier League announced last week that its clubs would not release players for international duty which involved travel to countries covered by the British government’s “red list” coronavirus restrictions. Uruguay is on that list, which would mean Cavani being required to quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days on his return to Britain. However, the Uruguayan federation has confirmed that Cavani would no longer be called up for the matches against Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador. Aston Villa announced on Sunday that their Argentina call-ups — Emi Martinez and Emi Buendia — would be released for that country’s first two qualifiers in the September break. They however stated that the players would miss the last one (match) against Bolivia. Under that arrangement, the club said, the players would only miss the Premier League game against Chelsea on Sept. 11.
