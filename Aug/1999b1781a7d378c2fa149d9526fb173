Gov. Ben Ayade of Cross River has slighly relaxed the curfew hours in Calabar that was between 10p.m. and 6a.m. to now last from 12 midnight to 6a.m.  This is contained in a statement by Mr Christian Ita, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Publicity, which was made available to newsmen on Monday in Calabar. “Following a review of the security situation in the state, Gov. Ben Ayade has ordered an immediate relaxation of the 10p.m. to 6a.m. curfew in the state. “Consequently, restriction of movement is now between the hours of 12 midnight and 6a.m., with effect from Aug. 2, 2021. “Members of the public can therefore go about their normal and lawful businesses between 6a.m. and 12 mid night,” he said. Recall that the governor in October last year imposed the curfew, following the destruction of property in Calabar by hoodlums who hijacked the #ENDSARS protest.
