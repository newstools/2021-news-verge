Romelu Lukaku has confirmed that he would wear the Chelsea number nine shirt vacated by Tammy Abraham.  The 28-year-old Belgium hitman, who has returned to Stamford Bridge from Inter Milan, was initially handed the number 18 jersey. But he jumped at the chance to take the main striker’s shirt following Abraham’s move to Roma. And the former Everton and Manchester United forward is now excited to become the focal point of the Blues’ attack and show his leadership qualities. “Yeah, I have the number nine shirt, I’m very happy and very fortunate to be in the situation,” Lukaku said. “Cesar Azpilicueta’s the captain, he’s been here for many years, he’s a great captain. When I was in quarantine he was already messaging me, to help about houses and things like that. “So, in terms of leaders, there are many players that have big personalities in this dressing room. “I’m one of the players who likes to connect everybody, and make everyone feel comfortable and give them confidence, because those players deserve to be Chelsea players and they showed that last season. “So, this dressing room has a lot of personality, which is what I like.” Belgium’s record goalscorer spent three years on Chelsea’s books between 2011 and 2014, and has already admitted to some unfinished business on his return to west London. “It’s good to be back. As a footballer, you fight to achieve your dreams. I’m here now and I can’t wait to get on the pitch and perform with my team-mates,” he said. 2020/2021 UEFA Champions League winners Chelsea started the 2021/2022 English Premier League campaign with a commanding 3-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday. They will head to Arsenal on Sunday brimming with confidence. Lukaku’s arrival will put another spring in the step of Thomas Tuchel’s team, with the marksman confirming he is fit and ready to go at the weekend.
