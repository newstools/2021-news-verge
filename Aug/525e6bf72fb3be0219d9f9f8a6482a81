The Police in Bayelsa have arrested one Abraham Kalizibe, ‘m’, 34 years, a native of Etegwe Community, Yenagoa, Bayelsa, for alleged robbery.  Also arrested was an alleged armourer, one Abadi Prosper ‘m’, 18 years, in whose custody two locally-made pistols and five cartridges were recovered. This is contained in a statement issued and made available to our reporter by SP Asinmin Butswait, the Police Public Relations Officer, (PPRO) of the Command in Yenagoa on Thursday. He said that the arrests were made successful following a tip-off. According to the PPRO, Kalizibe is a member of a notorious armed robbery gang terrorising Yenagoa and its environs. He said that upon interrogation the suspect confessed to series of armed robbery operations and later led police detectives to the alleged armed robbery gang’s armourer where the two locally made pistols and five cartridges were recovered. Butswait said the suspects were currently undergoing interrogation and would soon be charged to court upon conclusion of the investigation.
