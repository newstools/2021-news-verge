Gov. Gboyega Oyetola of Osun says efforts are on to put in place serious safety measures against natural disasters in the state.  Oyetola gave this indication on Tuesday while sympathising with residents of the state over the heavy downpour and flooding that ravaged Osogbo, the capital, on Tuesday. The governor spoke during an on-the-spot assessment to some of the affected areas in the state on Wednesday. Oyetola said government is working hard to forestall future occurrence of the ugly incident, adding that efforts had been put in place to ensure safety against natural disasters. He urged residents to stop indiscriminate refuse disposal in the State as it was established that many of the incidents were caused by the blockage of drainages and waterways. It was reported that heavy rain, which started on Tuesday evening and lasted till Wednesday afternoon, wrecked havoc in Osogbo. Buildings as well as properties, worth millions of naira, were destroyed by the heavy rain, with its attendant flooding, in Alekuwodo, Onireke, Obate, Awosuru, Sadiat, Testing Ground and Atimowa areas of Osogbo. The governor said the time had come for residents to adhere strictly to environmental safety tips, which, he said, remained the only way to permanently put an end to the menace. Oyetola expressed sympathy over the incident and assured that necessary steps would be taken to address the situation. He said relevant agencies, including emergency response and disaster management teams, had been contacted. “I went round to see things for myself and I can see that the damage was much. “We have seen areas requiring interventions like dredging activities. This will be attended to with immediate effect. “I sincerely sympathise with our people who have lost properties to the flood. It is unfortunate,” the governor said. Some of the areas visited by the governor included Oke-Ijetu, Alie community, Gbodofon community, Alekunwodo, GRA and Lameco areas.
