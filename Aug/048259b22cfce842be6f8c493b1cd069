UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday called on developed countries to provide more money for climate change adaptation in poorer parts of the world.  Guterres made the call following the alarming report issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) about the consequences of Earth’s warming. He demanded that politicians must take swift and drastic action. “The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable. “This report must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels, before they destroy our planet. If we combine forces now, we can avert climate catastrophe,” he said. He also called development banks to provide more money for climate change adaptation. He said an earlier pledge to raise 100 billion dollars a year for this must be fulfilled. ”There is no longer room for delay or excuses,” Guterres said, demanding that world leaders deliver answers at the next global climate change summit in November in Scotland. The meeting is seen as the most critical since a gathering in Paris in 2015. It was reported that in the IPCC report, the panel sounded a dire warning, saying the world is dangerously close to runaway warming and that humans are “unequivocally” to blame. Drawing on more than 14,000 scientific studies, the report gives the most comprehensive and detailed picture yet of how climate change is altering the natural world and what still could be ahead.
