Gov. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti has expressed sadness over the death of the Olosi of Olosi, Oba Oladiran Agunbiade.  Fayemi, in a statement on Friday in Ado-Ekiti, signed by Mr Yinka Oyebode, his Chief Press Secretary, said the late Agunbiade served the people of Osi-Ekiti and the state as custodian of the people’s culture and tradition. Recall that Agunbiade died on Wednesday. The governor said the deceased would be remembered for his wise counsel and sundry contributions to the development of Osi Ekiti and the state in general. Fayemi said the late traditional ruler left a worthy legacy of selfless service, through his invaluable contributions to the development of his community. He expressed his condolences to the family of the late traditional ruler, friends, associates and the Olosi-in-council. He prayed God to give the town a successor that would accord the welfare of the people and development of the community, top priority as the late Oba Agunbiade. “This is a great loss not only to Osi Ekiti but to the entire state. Agunbiade, no doubt, lived a fulfilled life. May God grant him eternal rest,”  the governor added
