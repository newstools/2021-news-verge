APS GLOBAL PARTNERS, AFRICAN ENTREPRENEURS AND STARTUP VISA PROGRAM The Canadian government had some time ago announced a new path to immigration to Canada. It is a program for startups. This means that if a person has a business idea, he can move to Canada for permanent residence and obtain a Canadian passport subsequently. A Canadian passport is a visa-free entry into about 172 countries. Access to the social security system begins shortly after the arrival in Canada. This includes free healthcare, education, retirement, and social protection. To obtain a Canadian Permanent Resident Visa under this program, one must be admitted to one of the business incubators, an angel investor group or a venture capital fund authorized by the government of Canada. Once a person is accepted, he gets a so-called Support Letter. This document is the basis for obtaining a residence permit through the Canadian Startup Visa Program.    DOCUMENTS APPLICANTS NEED TO APPLY  HOW APS GLOBAL PARTNERS HELPS The APS team will get the applicants through the process and help them to get APPROVED by one of the business organizations designated by the Canadian Ministry of Immigration.
