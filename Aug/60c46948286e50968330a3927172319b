The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Kaduna State, has denied the purported suspension of its Deputy Chairman, Ibrahim Kayarda, as being reported in the media.  The denial is contained in a statement signed by Abraham Katoh, the party’s Publicity Secretary, on Wednesday in Kaduna. Katoh said in the statement that Kayarda remained a bona fide member of PDP, adding that; “we are yet to receive any correspondence from his ward or local government party secretariat.” He described the report as false and a cheap media propaganda by some renegades of the party, determined to cause disaffection amongst party faithful. The Kaduna PDP Secretariat advised the public, and indeed party members, to disregard the propaganda and focus on winning the upcoming Lere Federal Constituency Bye-Election. “Any information on this matter that does not come from the state’s publicity secretary of the PDP office is completely false,” Katoh added in the statement.
