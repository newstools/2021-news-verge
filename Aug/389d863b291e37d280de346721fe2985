Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta, has assured residents that his administration would complete all good projects, started by his predecessors in the state.  Okowa gave the assurance on Friday, during the inauguration of the Ogini Grammar School, Ogharaefe, Oghara in Ethiope West Local Government Area of the state. The governor said his administration had completed nine of such school projects, assuring that the remaining two would be completed before the end of his tenure. He thanked former governor Emmanuel Uduaghan, for initiating the building of 12 modern schools, but completed one before he left office. “As a responsive government, we have been able to complete nine out of the remaining 11 uncompleted schools by the immediate past administration. “We assure that the remaining two  will be completed before the end of our tenure,” he said. Okowa urged the students to study hard as leaders of tomorrow, noting that the foundation laid for children determined their future. “Our children should study hard, it is not just having good building. The success of tomorrow starts today. With the facilities in this school, we will rename it as Ogini Modern College,” he said. The governor, however, commended the state Ministry of Secondary Education and the contractor for ensuring the project was completed and delivered. He also thanked the traditional ruler and people of Oghara for providing an  enabling environment. Earlier, the governor inaugurated the Omene Road, Lawrence/Iju Road, Labead Road, Onosa Road among others in both Sapele and Jesse communities. Okowa, thereafter, proceeded to inaugurate the Oghara Ultra Modern Market.
