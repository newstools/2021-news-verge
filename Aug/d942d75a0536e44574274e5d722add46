Governor Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State has lauded the peaceful conduct of the All Progressive Congress (APC) Ward Congress in the state.  Yahaya gave the commendation on Sunday during an affirmation exercise, led by Ward Congress National Chairman, Dr Danjuma Dabo, at Jekadafari Ward Gombe. He said APC members in Gombe state opted for consensus through affirmation. Yahaya said people who refused to align with the ruling APC, would not be coerced to join. According to Yahaya, Nigeria operates a democratic system, therefore, there won’t be the need to compel association, adding that such people should be willing to accept defeat. “Nigeria is a democracy, we are not coercing anybody to come to join APC, and we are for the people. So let them come to contest but once you are beaten hands down you must accept it,” he said. “We earlier resolved during our stakeholders that we should go by consensus and affirmation,” he said. Dr Danjuma Dabo, APC Ward Congress National Chairman, Gombe State, expressed satisfaction with the peaceful conduct of the exercise. “We are satisfied with the way they have handled the congress at the different wards we monitored,” he said. Explaining why the Congress was conducted on Sunday instead of Saturday, the Chairman said the congress was not like election, it has no time bound. According to him, the committee started on Saturday with documentation and by the time they finished it was late.
