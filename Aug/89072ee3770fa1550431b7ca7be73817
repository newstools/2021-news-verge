Biggie disclosed only to Maria that no housemate would be leaving the show but that was only a prank Maria needed to execute, as Biggie promised to reward Maria if the plan was well executed. Meanwhile, all the housemates believed that at least two of the nominated housemates would be leaving the show on Sunday evening, the eviction night. Finally, Maria was made to nominate 6 housemates for possible eviction few hours to the eviction time. The housemates nominated by Maria were Pere, her closest male housemate, Emmanuel, Angel, Yousef, Jaypaul and JMK.
