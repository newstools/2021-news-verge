The Kano State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says its loyalty to the party’s national leadership remains total and unwavering.  The State PDP Chairman, Mr Shehu Wada-Sagagi, said this in a statement issued to newsmen on Wednesday in Kano while responding to calls for the resignation of Uche Secondus by some PDP members in the state. “We received with dismay the news that a non existing group named: Coalition of Support Groups of PDP, Kano State, called for the resignation of our National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus. “In fact, it is the evil machinations of the enemies of our party in the state. “It is important to for the general public to know that our party members in the state remain loyal to our National Executive Council, National Working Committee and the Board of Trustees. “We are working tirelessly to see the success of our party in the upcoming 2023 general elections,” he said. The chairman, therefore, called for calm and prayers for the progress of the party. “We therefore call on the national party leaders and party members across the country to disregard such ill-conceived call. “We appreciate Secondus’ leadership style and his efforts to move the party forward. “He is the first national chairman to be in the opposition, all the previous ones have been chairmen with the ruling party at the national level. “That is why some people don’t appreciate that, but we in Kano, who have been in the opposition from 2015 to date, know how difficult it is to operate under that atmosphere. “We appreciate his leadership style and stand by him,” Wada-Sagagi said.
