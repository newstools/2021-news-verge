President Muhammadu Buhari has felicitated Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege, on his 58th birthday, Aug. 3, 2021.  In a congratulatory message by his spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, in Abuja on Monday, Buhari joined All Progressives Congress (APC) leadership and members to celebrate with the party chieftain. According to the president, Omo-Agege’s dedication to good governance and democratic growth remains outstanding. He congratulated the deputy president of the Senate of the 9th National Assembly on another milestone, measured out by God’s grace, and saluted his commitment to development of Delta and the country. Omo-Agege had served variously as Commissioner for Special Duties and Secretary to the Delta State Government before his election to the Senate in 2015. The president believed Omo-Agege’s down-to-earth leadership style, coupled with his foresight and generosity in sharing ideas had been most pivotal in the harmonious relationship with lawmakers. He, therefore, appreciated him for always bringing his vast experience as a lawyer to shape party issues and national discourse. Buhari prayed for his good health, strength, and continued service to God and mankind
