The embattled Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State, Mr Adedeji Doherty, has expressed grief over the sudden death of his main challenger, Dr Adegbola Dominic, on Wednesday.  Doherty, in a statement on Wednesday evening in Lagos entitled “PDP grieves over the death of former State Chairman, Dr Adegbola Dominic,” said that Dominic’s death was a huge loss to the party. He said that Dominic was until his death a foremost leader of the party in the state and a political force to reckon with. Doherty said: “He was a party leader whose contributions to the party in all ramifications cannot be wished away and are very highly appreciated. “This is a huge loss to the party at this time, as we are well aware of the prominent roles he played until his death in ensuring a better and stronger party. “He will be very dearly missed and unforgettable as we wished he should still be around with us. We are, however, consoled by the fact that he is with Him who loves him most.” The embattled chairman prayed that God would grant the deceased eternal rest and peace. “We also pray that God would grant us all the fortitude to bear the huge loss,” he added. It was reported that both Doherty and Dominic have been claiming the chairmanship seat of the main opposition party. Justice Oyekan Abdullahi of the Lagos High Court had on June 23 removed Doherty as Lagos State PDP Chairman and reinstated Dominic. Our correspondent also recalls that the State Secretary of the PDP, Prince Muiz Dosunmu-Shodipe, died on July 28 and buried on July 30.
