The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, says the Federal Government is committed to finalisation of the boundary demarcation exercise between Nigeria and Cameroun.  Dr Umar Gwandu, the Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations to the Minister disclosed this on Wednesday, in Abuja. Malami had given the assurance while receiving the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for West Africa and the Sahel, Mahamat Saleh Annadif, who paid him a courtesy visit. “I wish to assure you that the Nigerian delegation is confident that under your leadership, the Cameroun-Nigeria Mixed Commission, (CNMC) will continue to achieve more successes. “Particularly, in its efforts to permanently demarcate the boundary between Cameroun and Nigeria, in line with the judgment of the International Court of Justice and other relevant Treaties and Declarations,” he said. He expressed optimism that the steps taken in resolving the outstanding areas of disagreement would be fully and legally demarcated in no distant time. He said “It will be appreciated if all aspects of the areas of disagreement are resolved and demarcated in accordance with the judgment of the International Court of Justice, without fear or favour. “The proposed session of the Cameroun-Nigeria Mixed Commission (CNMC) that will be convened soon in Yaounde, will pave the way for landmark achievements, including the demarcation exercise.” In his remarks, Mahamt Annadif said his visit had opened an outstanding chapter in the international relations and diplomacy, with a view to promoting peace among brother nations. He said the engagement was proof that African problems could be solved using African solutions by Africans, especially on the mutual understanding between the two neighbouring countries.
