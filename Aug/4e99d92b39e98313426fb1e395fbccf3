The Conservator-General (CP) of Nigerian National Park Service, Dr Ibrahim Goni has charged newly decorated officers to free the various parks in the country from criminal elements.  Goni gave the charge on Monday in Abuja during the decoration of two promoted officers from the Conservator of Park to the rank of Assistant Conservator General (ACG). The newly decorated officers are Mohammed Kabir and Amed Abdullahi. He also urged them to work diligently and boost the national parks as contribution to the success of the administration of President Muhammadu  Buhari. He noted that Abdullahi would head the Department of Works and Maintenance, while Kabir would head the Human Resources department of the national parks. The CG added that management of that park would ensure officers realised their potential. “I charge you to work round the clock to positively impact the service through your respective departments. “I congratulate you on your decoration today and wish you success,” he said. Responding, Kabir commended the CG and the management team of the park for commitment to staff welfare. He assured the management of their total commitment to the various responsibilities given to them, promising not to be found wanting.
