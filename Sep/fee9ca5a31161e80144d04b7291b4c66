A 41-year-old man, Rahman Ogundele, who allegedly stole 55,000 dollars from his employer, on Monday appeared in a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos.  The police charged the defendant, a former staff with theft. He, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Magistrate Adeola Olatubosun, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N5 million with two sureties in the like sum. She consequently adjourned the matter until Oct. 20 for mention.
