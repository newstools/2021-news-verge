An APC Chieftain in Ekiti State, Otunba Segun Agbalajobi, on Wednesday commended INEC for improving the electoral process.  He told our reporter in Ado-Ekiti that of particular note was the effectiveness of INEC in the on-going voter registration. Agbalajobi added that continuous innovation in strengthening the credibility of voter accreditation and result management at elections were other milestone achievements of the electoral body. “As always, the deployment of appropriate technology is crucial and desirable thus the introduction of machine-readable Permanent Voters Card (PVC) combined with the Smart Card Reader are important innovations. “Also of note is the electronic uploading of results in real-time on Election Day,” he said. The APC chieftain advised the electorate to regard the on-going voter registration as a giant stride toward successful polling in the state in 2022. He called on APC supporters and members in particular to take advantage of the INEC’s online Continuous Voter Registration exercise and register. Agbalajobi stressed the need for party members to complete the registration process at designated centres where they could obtain their PVCs. He said it had become imperative for APC members across the country to equip themselves with the voters’ cards to enable them to vote in the coming governorship election in Ekiti State as well as during the 2023 general elections. “Your vote is your power and that power begins with voter registration and for continuity you must all have the voters card,’’ he admonished.
