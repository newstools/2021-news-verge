Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has compensated families of two operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) who died in the cause of duties with N10 million each.  The Media Director of RRS, Mr Taofiq Adebayo, disclosed this on Friday in a statement, stressing that the governor was fulfilling his pledge to always give wholesome support to the security agencies in the state. Adebayo said that the governor was represented by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Mr Gboyega Soyannwo, who presented the two cheques to the affected families at Government House, Alausa-Ikeja. He said the two families were that of late SPY/PC Omale Job and SPY/PC Adeniran Adekunle. The director said that Mrs Tosin Adeniran and Master Ayomide Adeniran represented Late SPY/PC Adeniran Adekunle, while Mrs Juliana Omale and Master David Omale respresented Late SPY/PV Omale Job.
