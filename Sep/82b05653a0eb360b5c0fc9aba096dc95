Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has said that he received with sadness and deep feeling, the news of the passing away of the Emir of Gaya, Alhaji Ibrahim Abdulkadir.  Abdukkadir died on Wednesday at the age of 91 and left behind three wives, 28 children and many grandchildren. The Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, stated this in a statement he issued to newsmen on Wednesday in Kano. “Despite his ailing condition, the monarch’s uncommon leadership qualities earned him respect as traditional ruler since his days as Sarkin Gaya and until his death as First Class Emir in Kano. “The death of the Emir in one of the oldest Emirates in Northern Nigeria, has created a vacuum difficult to be filled considering his contributions to peace, stability and progress of his domain and the country,” he said. The commissioner revealed that Abdukkadir was one of the four Emirs elevated to First Class Emirs by the Gov. Ganduje administration after the creation of Rano, Gaya, Bichi and Karaye Emirates in 2019. “Gov. Ganduje, who is away in Abuja when the Emir’s death was announced said the demise of the monarch is a big loss to his immediate family, Gaya Emirate, the government and the entire people of Kano state,” he said. He, therefore, prayed to Allah in His infinite mercy to forgive his sins and grant him Aljannah Firdausi. Garba also quoted the governor as calling on the people of the emirate to bear the loss with the spirit of acquiescence to God’s will. The governor also urged them to take solace in the fact that endurance was not the measure of a good life but the sense of fulfilment.
