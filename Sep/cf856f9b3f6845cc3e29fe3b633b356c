Gov. Simon Lalong of Plateau has called for more prayers and vigilance for the state’s security and Nigeria’s unity.  Lalong made the call at a mass he attended on Sunday in Shendam. In a statement signed by his Director of Media and Publicity, Dr Simon Macham, the governor at the mass encouraged the congregants not to lose faith due to the recent unfortunate events that occurred in the state. Lalong said there was need for more prayers and vigilance. “The recent unfortunate developments in the state have been largely contained, but more work needs to be done to prevent re-occurrence. Lalong, who reiterated that security was a joint responsibility of everyone, thanked the church for constantly upholding his government in prayers. “I thank you for consistently upholding the government in prayers and also offering pieces of advice and solutions to the challenges of the state, including insecurity. “Though the church has contributed a lot in educating citizens and sensitising them towards embracing peace and harmony, as well as showing love to people of various backgrounds. “Be reminded that security is a joint responsibility which requires the collaboration of citizens, government and law enforcement agencies who must always unite against criminals,” he said. Rev. Father Michael Kelong, the Parish Priest, expressed appreciation to the governor for the visit and promised that the congregation would continue to pray and advise the government. In his Homily, Rev. Bulus Diarshap, urged Christians to be alive to their duties as believers by showing compassion, mercy and consideration for one another. “Lack of adherence to the examples of Jesus Christ to love and respect the sanctity of life is responsible for most of the crises in the world,” he said. It was reported that Hon. Livinus Kwapfuan, member representing Shendam constituency in the House of Assembly and Hon. Alex Naantuam, Chairman Shendam LGA, were among those who accompanied the governor to the church service.
