The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, says Nigeria will host the UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) Regional Conference in 2022.  The minister disclosed this in Sal Island, Cape Verde, after a meeting with the Secretary-General of the UNWTO, Mr Zurab Pololikashvili. It was reported that the UNWTO, founded on Nov. 1, 1975, is the UN specialised agency entrusted with the promotion of responsible, sustainable and universally accessible tourism. It was also reported that Mohammed is in Sal Island, with other African Culture and Tourism Ministers, to attend the 64th Conference of UNWTO Commission for Africa and the Second Edition of the UNWTO Global Tourism Investment Forum. Speaking with our reporter after meeting Pololikashvili, the minister said the regional conference, to be hosted in Nigeria, would focus on tourism and creative industry. He said the tourism and creative industry team was chosen because of the comparative advantage and strong points of Nigeria in the areas of films, music, fashion and the creative industry. “Comparatively, Nigeria is not very strong in destination tourism though the country attracts many travellers who are more on businesses. “Nigeria is better known for its music, films and for its culture and Nigeria music and films are exported for foreign exchange. “There are many Nigerian artistes that have gained global recognition, among who are Burna Boy and Whiz Kid, who won the latest Grammy Awards in different categories,” he said. The minister recalled that Burna Boy, a Nigerian Superstar, recently sold out at the 02 Arena in London. Burna Boy was reported to have shut down 02 Arena with incredible 12,000 tickets sale for his concert held in Aug. 27. The 61st edition of the ongoing UNWTO Commission for Africa conference was held in Nigeria in 2018.
