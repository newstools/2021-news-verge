Magashi also assessed the level of progress of the “Basic English Course” for the armed forces of Sao Tome and Principe, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence. The Sao Tome and Principe’s armed forces played key role in providing security in the election which held on Sept. 5 in the archipelagic country. The country lies about 250 nautical miles south of Bonny in the Gulf of Guinea. Nigeria and Sao Tome and Principe have overlapping “Exclusive Economic Zones”, designated as “Joint Development Zone”.
