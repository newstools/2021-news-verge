Mr Bitrus Kaze, State Chairmanship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Plateau, has urged the party’s congress organising committee to “uphold integrity without fear or favour” while conducting the elective congress on Saturday.  Recall that the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party had on June 10 dissolved the Plateau Executive Committee following series of litigations. Subsequently, the Sen. Tunde Ogbeha led Caretaker Committee was constituted. The state caretaker committee was to oversee the affairs of the state for a period of not more than 90 days with effect from June 10. As result, the elective state congress of the party was scheduled to hold on Sept. 25 in Jos. Kaze in an interview with our reporter on Friday in Jos urged the committee to avoid the things that took the party in the state to its present position. He implored the committee to insist on the integrity of the processes, saying Plateau people wanted the PDP to take over the state. “When a party that is in the heart of the people does not offer credibility, it makes the people to suffer. “We have no reason to repeat party congress in Plateau but if the integrity of the process is faulted, if the credibility is questioned, it promotes acrimony, disagreements and court cases. “In the last instance we were able to prove that we were not just making noise, we were right. “If there are issues that need clearance, the party should look at them critically and clear the issues. “I implore the committee to pursue integrity to the best of its ability without fear or favour,” he said.
