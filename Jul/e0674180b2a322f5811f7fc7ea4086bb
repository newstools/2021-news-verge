Net interest income stood at N9.87 billion, representing nine per cent increase from the N9.06 billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2020. Commenting on the result, the Managing Director, Unity Bank Plc, Mrs Tomi Somefun, said the performance was encouraging in spite of the economic challenges. Somefun said the double-digit growth recorded in both earnings and profits was the result of a portfolio plan, which the bank embarked on at the beginning of the year to diversify its portfolio. She added that the bank pursued asset creation in petrochemical downstream, consumer, healthcare and general commerce, with agribusiness providing the bulwark for identified business and brand benefits. She said the bank would be looking to strengthen its balance sheet from the liability side as it continued to grow its brand franchise in many areas of the retail market by promoting and leveraging its agriculture value chain businesses.
