FC Barcelona and Neymar have reached an amicable agreement to end their long-running dispute over the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) forward’s contract.  The Brazil international had claimed he was owed 43.6 million euros (51.3 million dollars) in unpaid bonuses by the Spanish La Liga giants. Neymar insisted he was due the huge sum as a loyalty bonus, having signed a new five-year contract with the Catalan club in 2016. A judge ruled in Barca’s favour in June 2020, ordering Neymar to pay his former employers 6.7 million euros. Barca on Monday revealed the case is now closed. A club statement said: “FC Barcelona announces that it has extrajudicially closed amicably different labour and civil litigations that had opened with the Brazilian player Neymar da Silva Santos Junior. “Thus, the club and the player have signed a transactional agreement to end legal proceedings pending between both parties: three claims in the labour jurisdiction and one civil proceeding.” Neymar joined PSG for a world record fee of 222 million euros in August 2017.
