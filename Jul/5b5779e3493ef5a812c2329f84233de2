He assured the victims of government’s support, and directed the state Ministry of Health and State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), to provide emergency support to the victims in Girgir and Jakusko. The governor also directed SEMA to provide the victims with relief materials to cushion their hardships, and compile comprehensive report on the destructions and the assistance required. Mala-Buni charged residents in the area to also support the victims who lost their houses and farmlands to the flood disaster. “We should be our brothers keepers and complement government efforts to make the victims comfortable,” the governor was quoted as saying the statement. He appealed to the people in flood prone areas to vacate waterways to ensure free flow of rain water.
