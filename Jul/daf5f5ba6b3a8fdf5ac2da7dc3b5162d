Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) on Thursday confirmed the signing of former Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos on a free transfer.  This was after the Spanish central defender penned on a two-year contract with the Ligue 1 giants. Ramos left Real Madrid after 16 years when his contract expired at the end of June. The 35-year-old veteran won the UEFA Champions League four times with Los Blancos and scored 101 goals in his 671 appearances. “This is a big change in my life, a new challenge and it’s a day I will never forget. I am very proud to be a part of this ambitious project, to be a part of this squad with so many great players,” Ramos told PSG TV. With the national team, Ramos won the FIFA World Cup in 2010 and two Euro Championships in 2008 and 2012. He also became the most-capped Spanish player (and European player) of all time with 180 appearances. Ramos has twice been named UEFA Defender of the Year (2017 and 2018) and has featured 11 times in the FIFA/FIFPro World XI between 2008 and 2020. “Sergio is a complete footballer, one of the best defenders in the history of the game. He is a born competitor, a leader and a true professional. “His vast experience and ambition are in perfect synergy with those of the club,” PSG chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi said. Ramos is PSG’s third signing of the summer after the arrival of Morocco defender Achraf Hakimi from Inter Milan and Georginio Wijnaldum, who also joined as a free agent.
