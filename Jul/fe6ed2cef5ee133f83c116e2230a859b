The bears resurfaced on the nation’s bourse on Thursday, halting gains posted in the last three trading sessions due to profit taking.  Specifically, the All-Share Index dipped 31.44 points or 0.18 per cent to close at 38,469.87 from 38,501.31 achieved on Wednesday. Similarly, the market capitalisation lost N27 billion or 0.13 per cent to close at N20.043 trillion against N20.070 trillion on Wednesday. Profit-taking in Guaranty Trust Bank Holding Company and 15 others dragged the All-Share Index (ASI) down by 0.08 per cent. In summary, the All-Share Index (ASI) declined by 31.44 points, representing a loss of 0.08 per cent to close at 38,469.87 points. Similarly, the overall market capitalisation shed N27 billion, representing a decrease of 0.13 per cent to close at N20.043 trillion. The disparity between the ASI and the market capitalisation was due to the adjustment in the equity price of Fidson healthcare Plc (from N6.34 per share to N6.09 per share) for dividend payment. The downturn of the market was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks amongst which are: NASCON Allied Industries, Guaranty Trust Bank Holding Company, Access Bank, Stanbic IBTC Holdings and United Bank for Africa.
