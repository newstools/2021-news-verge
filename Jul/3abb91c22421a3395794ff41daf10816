The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has invited former Governor of Nasarawa State and serving senator, Tanko Al-Makura, and his wife, Mairo, over alleged corruption.  A source at the commission disclosed this to our reporter on Wednesday evening. As of the time of filing this report, the couple were being grilled by operatives of the anti-graft agency at its headquarters in Abuja. The source did not give details of the allegation against the ex-governor and his wife. Spokesperson of EFCC, Mr Wilson Uwujaren when contacted by our correspondent declined comment on the couple’s arrest. Al-Makura was the Governor of Nasarawa State between 2011 and 2019 before he was elected as Senator representing Nasarawa South Senatorial District at the National Assembly.
