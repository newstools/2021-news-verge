A former governor of Lagos State, Sen. Bola Tinubu, has welcomed Zamfara Governor, Bello Matawalle, to the All Progressives Congress (APC).  Tinubu, one of the leaders of APC, in a statement by his Media Aide, Mr Tunde Rahman, said the move by Matawalle showed that he was dedicated to bringing good governance to his state. “Along with all other APC members, I heartily welcome Matawalle into the APC. “The move by Matawalle is the best way to ensure good governance in the state by being  a member of the party that was founded on democratic ideals,” he said. Tinubu urged Matawalle to work more closely with President Muhammadu Buhari to help realise his progressive mandate and tackle challenges. He said APC’s doors were open to those who wanted democracy to flourish. “The entry of governors Matawalle, David Umahi of Ebonyi and Ben Ayade of Cross River into the party demonstrates that the APC umbrella is succinctly broad to accommodate all those with valuable ideas and contributions to the party and our country,” he added.
