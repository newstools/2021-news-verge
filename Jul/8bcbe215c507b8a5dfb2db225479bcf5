Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje has expressed appreciation to APC stakeholders for agreeing to conduct the forthcoming ward congress in Kano State under a consensus arrangement.  Ganduje expressed his appreciation on Sunday at a stakeholders meeting held at Government House, Kano. “I am delighted to see that you have all decided that the forthcoming ward congress, slated for Saturday, July 31, be conducted under consensus arrangement,“ the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Abba Anwar, quoted Ganduje in a statement he released on Sunday in Kano. “We thank you for taking this decision, this decision of yours will surely strengthen the process and make our party to be more peaceful. “We were happy with the result we saw last time during our local government elections when we followed your advice. “It was only in one local government that election took place for the chairmanship position and at the end it was the person earlier endorsed by the stakeholders that made it,” Ganduje noted. He said the consensus agreement adopted during the local government election had saved the party from plunging into crisis. “We don’t want crisis in our party, that is why we are always determined to accept decision of our stakeholders at whatever level in the state,” he said He, however, said that those to be endorsed as party leaders must be loyal members, who were committed and determined to move the party forward. Ganduje said that the confirmation of consensus candidates must be held at the party offices at the ward level not in individual homes. The statement quoted the stakeholders as assuring the governor that they would do their best to ensure that the party remained strong at all times and in all places.
