A 26-year-old welder, Quadri Yusuf, who allegedly robbed a man of his phones and pieces of jewellery valued N1.8million, on Monday appeared before a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos.  Yusuf, a resident of Makoko area of Lagos, is facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and robbery. He, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. Police prosecutor, ASP A.R. Momah, told the court that the defendant committed the offences at 2 a.m. on June 7, at No. 59, Irepodun St., Agege, Lagos. According to her, the defendant and his accomplices (who are still at large) broke into the house of the complainant, Mr Isaac Ibitoye, at night and stole his phones and pieces of jewellery. She said that the defendant stole an iPhone 6, an iPhone 8, an Infinix Hot 10 phone, a Tecno Spark 4 phone, an ATM card and pieces of jewellery, with a total value of N1.8million. Momah further told the court that the defendants’ accomplices escaped the scene of the crime with their weapons before the police arrived and it was only the defendant that was apprehended. The offences contravene Sections 297 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015, as revised. It was reported that Section 297 stipulates 21 years imprisonment for the offence of robbery. Chief Magistrate, Mrs Adeola Adedayo, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N300,000 with two sureties in like sum. She directed that both sureties must be residents within the court’s jurisdiction and be gainfully employed with evidence of three years tax payment to Lagos State Government. Adedayo added that one of the sureties must have a landed property within the court’s jurisdiction and both sureties must submit copies of their National Identification Number (NIN) to the court. Adedayo further instructed that a copy of the case file be sent to the office of the Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP) for legal advice. She adjourned the case until Aug. 16 for mention.
