Some gunmen allegedly attacked the home of Yoruba self determination activist, Sunday Igboho, in the early hours of Thursday. The gunmen reportedly raided his house in Soka, Ibadan, Oyo State around 1:00 a.m. The development was confirmed by Mr Igboho’s spokesperson, Olayomi Koiki. He told reporters that the gunmen were seen in military uniforms when carrying out the attack. This newspaper has not been able to independently verify his claims yet. But sources in the area said there was pandemonium in the Soka community in the midnight following sporadic gunshots. Mr Igboho’s vehicles, including his G-wagon, Prado Jeep, and some properties including furniture, and windows were reportedly destroyed. A close ally of Mr Igboho identified as ‘Lady K’, was allegedly whisked away by the gunmen. The police spokesperson in Oyo State, Adewale Osifeso, did not respond to PREMIUM TIMES calls and text messages as of the time of filing this report.
