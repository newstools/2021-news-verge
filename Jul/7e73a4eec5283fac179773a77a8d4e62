The Speaker, House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila, has called for prayers and unity of purpose among Nigerians at this period of Eid-el-Kabir.  Gbajabiamila, in a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, in Abuja on Monday, urged Nigerians to conduct themselves in a patriotic manner as “we have no other country to call our own”. He said that as people that believed and worshipped God, Nigerians, especially Muslims, should use the opportunity of the Eid-el-Kabir to pray for their leaders to be able to find solutions to the nation’s problems. Gbajabiamila said Nigerians must remain united and steadfast at all times to be able to face the challenges confronting the country. He called on Muslims to imbibe the habit of sacrifice and love for one another as characterised by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (SAW). The speaker said there was more that united us as a people, hence the need for togetherness and peaceful coexistence. “I congratulate my Muslim compatriots for marking this year’s Eid-el-Kabir. This is a time for us to be more united as a people. “As Muslims, we must make frantic efforts to emulate the virtues of the Holy Prophet, whose life is a perfect example of what we all should be. “The act of sacrifice, one of the major lessons of the Eid-el-Kabir, should be part of our lives at all times. We must make sacrifices for ourselves, our families, our friends, our neighbours and of course, our country. “I enjoin all of us to continue to be good citizens and make meaningful contributions for our continuous peaceful coexistence,” Gbajabiamila said.
