Gov. Nasir El-rufai of Kaduna state said on Tuesday that he was deeply worried by the hardship of the people occasioned by the security challenges in the state.  In his remarks during the presentation of the Kaduna State Security Incidents Report for the Second Quarter of 2021, the governor said the security report presented had sobering statistics on the state of security in the state. “The data on security incidents in the state during the second quarter of 2021 reflects the real agony of our citizens and communities, their pains and losses, and the fears and anxiety that have created considerable distress” he said. He noted that the report also outlined what the Kaduna State Government and the security agencies were doing to contain the situation. El-Rufai however lamented that the considerable investments in security were yet to manifest in the defeat, or at least the considerable degradation of the criminals. He reiterated his administration’s commitment to continue supporting security agencies, just as he appealed for the support of Federal Government in making up the manpower deficit in the security sector. He appealed to citizens and residents of Kaduna State, to remain law-abiding, and to uphold peace in their communities. He specifically urged community and traditional leaders in Zangon Kataf and Jema’a Local Government Areas, not to relent in their drive for peace. He sympathised with the people and security agents for all the pains and sorrow caused by the situation. “I assure you that we are working hard to solve this problem and it is our solemn duty to do so,” he pledged.
