Mr Awwal Mashi, Resident Electoral Commissioner, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Kaduna, said no fewer than 4,000 applicants accessed the online Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) portal, one week after commencement of the exercise.  Mashi said in an interview with our reporter on Monday in Kaduna that the figure represented applicants seeking for new registration, those effecting changes of data, and those applying for change of cards, among others. “In the entire North Central and North West geopolitical zones, apart from FCT, Kaduna has the highest number of people who have visited the net over the CVR,” Mashi said. He explained that the CVR involves “two phases – the soft or online registration and the off-line registration.” Mashi said that the commission would begin the second phase of the exercise and that arrangement would be made for applicants who had concluded the online process, to complete the registration at the office of the commission. “We shall from June 19, commence the second phase of the CVR, including the off-line process, for those who may have had challenges accessing the net. “Potential voters would be asked same questions on the net, while computer operators with the commission would insert answers to those questions thrown to them. Mashi said that the commission was aware of challenges faced by applicants, especially those in the rural dwellers, promising that arrangements had been made to addressing them. “We understand the difficulties of accessing the internet in rural areas – lack of android phones and data, even in the cities, but beginning from June 19, voters can visit our offices across the local government areas in the state. “We intend to have a center each at the local government offices and two roving teams, depending on how large a particular local government is,” the commissioner said.
