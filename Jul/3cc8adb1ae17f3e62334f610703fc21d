On its part, the Movement for the Actualisation of Sovereign State of Biafra condemned the arrest of the agitator.  The pro-Biafra group, in a statement on Wednesday by its National Director of Information, Edeson Samuel, said the arrest of agitators without addressing the cause of agitations was a ploy of Buhari’s regime to “intimidate the southern part of this political entity called Nigeria.” It noted that a government that could not arrest leaders of herdsmen, bandits, and Boko Haram, who were terrorising the country especially in Northern Nigeria, was using all its strength against freedom agitators in the South. The group stated, “MASSOB has already warned Muhammadu Buhari- led All Progressives Congress that nothing should happen to Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho. Nigerian security has failed to arrest leaders of herdsmen, bandits, and Boko Haram in the North, but using all its strength against freedom agitators in the South. “Kidnapping is going on everyday in Kaduna, Zamfara and other states in the North, but these Fulani foot soldiers cannot do anything because they are working together. “It is very clear now to the entire world that the Federal Government of Nigeria led by General Muhammadu Buhari is pampering terrorists known as killer herders and sending its security agents against non-violent self-determination groups because of the hatred it has for the South and the Middle Belt. “MASSOB still maintains its stand that no harm should befall Sunday Igboho, Nnamdi Kanu and other freedom agitators held in the DSS and police custody.”
