Sentiments on the domestic bourse turned negative on Tuesday to halt the five consecutive days of gains, as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) held all policy parameters unchanged.  Specifically, the All-Share Index lost 46.93 points or 0.12 per cent to close at 38,802.15 from the 38,849.08 recorded on Monday. Consequently, the month-to-date gain moderated to 2.4 per cent, while the year-to-date loss increased to 3.7 per cent. Also, market capitalisation which opened at N20.240 trillion shed N24 billion or 0.12 per cent to close at N20.216 trillion. The downturn was due to investors’ selloff sentiment in some bellwether stocks, as the market awaited the release of more half year results of listed companies. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) concluded its two-day policy meeting and voted to leave all policy parameters unchanged. Accordingly, the benchmark interest rate (MPR) was maintained at 11.50 per cent; asymmetric corridor remained at +100/-700 bps around the MPR; the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) was held at 27.50 per cent; and the Liquidity Ratio was retained at 30.00 per cent. The market loss was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks amongst which are; MTN Nigeria Communications, UPDC Real Estate Investment Trust, Africa Prudential, Unilever Nigeria and International Breweries. The market closed at par with 20 gainers as against 20 losers. Oando recorded the highest price gain of 9.86 per cent to close at N4.79 per share.
