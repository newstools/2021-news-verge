Hon. Rasheed Makinde, representating Ifako-Ijaiye/Ojokoro Local Council Development Area (LCDA) in Lagos State, has called on the incoming local government executives and legislators, to see their positions as ‘calls to duty’.  Makinde, in an interview with our reporter after casting his vote at Unit 54, Ward 5 in the ongoing Local Government election in Lagos, said the incoming politicians should have in mind that whatever they do, history would record. “They should be transparent, use taxpayer’s money judiciously, involve members of the community in their programmes, budget and all they are doing,” Makinde added. Makinde said the government has been living up to expectations of the people in the community, hence there is the need for continuity, by having credible electorates on seat. “The state government has been gracious to us in this community. Under one year, we have commissioned 30 roads and now we are working on our major corridor of six to eight more roads. “Apart from the roads, we have other executed projects, so the people have been given reasons to come out and vote for continuity in governance,“ he said. Also Hon. Oyekunle Olalekan, Councillor, Ward C, Ojokoro LCDA, has promised that if re-elected, he would build on existing projects to sustain progress in the community. Olalekan said: “I have carried out some projects like, building educational centres for youths, organised empowerment for women of the community, and still hope to touch other areas.” He, however, decried the low turnout of voters, saying there was a high level of apathy which he attributed to the short period of campaign, poor awareness and issues of COVID-19.
