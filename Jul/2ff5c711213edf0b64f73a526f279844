While expressing her dismay towards the criminal silence of Mr Bola Audu to clear air on the allegation, the Oyo state chapter chairman said Mr Audu had failed to clear self from this unholy shoddy allegation levelled against him and instead of trying to clear issues relating to anti-human related allegation, the bearer resolved to continue chasing personal issues he has with persons without considering the image of the union his actions and inactions pose to soil. ”As a social commentator, author and consistent labour activist, maintaining neutrality on issues of such magnitude will have huge negative effect on the image of ASCSN – a platform a lot of right thinking comrades have stand tall to defend and promote  before now.  Our stands however doesn’t mean we have personal issues against Mr Bola Audu but it is in a bid to depend, protect and jealously promote the name, image and history of our collective patrimony, ASCSN”,the statement added. Balogun added that ”from our prognosis, ASCSN is the largest industrial Union in Nigeria and it stands as the hope of most voiceless civil servants”, harping that ”on this ground, the union ”cannot allow any anti- human or anti-union self serving interest deter the union from pursuing its aims of establishment, which is to depend, protect and promote the work related interest of public servants from level 7 and above in Nigeria. So we are fully supportive to the expulsion of Mr Bola Audu from ASCSN”.
