Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has urged youths of the All Progressives  Congress  in the state to lead Nigerian youths in the quest to overcome the various challenges facing the country.  Akeredolu gave the advice on Tuesday in Akure at the Ondo State Progressives Youth, (ODPYS) Stakeholders roundtable discussion tagged “Patriotic Partisanship: Driving an Agenda of Inclusion and Collective Growth”. He said that the youths should show the way out of the various problems facing the country and unveil ideologies for the development of the nation. The governor said there was the  need to reorganise the mindset of the Nigerian youths for different approaches and means of engagement to target the management of diverse perspectives. According to him, there is urgent need for the concept of patriotic partisanship which emphasises on the need to put the country first before individual interest. “Nigeria is desperately in need of a paradigm shift in ideology of what political offices should be, and birthing the new age of the Nigerian politician to focus primarily on the development of Nigeria,” he said. Earlier, Ade Adetimehin, Acting State Chairman of APC , emphasized that the youths must have a mission and vision with good mentorship to be able to carry the baton of leadership. Mr. Lawal Kolade, Southwest Youth Leader, APC, appreciated Akeredolu for the appointment of 70 per cent of youths so far in his second term in office. Also Mr. Babajide Akeredolu, National Coordinator Pentagon Movement Group (PMG), said the roundtable discussion was to focus on strategic dialogue to instigate action towards having a strong, vibrant future for the next generation and the unborn.
