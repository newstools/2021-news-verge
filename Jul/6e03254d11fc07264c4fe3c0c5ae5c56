The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun confirmed that the latest number brings to 13 the number of people who died in the accident. The Sector Commander of the FRSC in the state, Mr Ahmed Umar, told our reporter on Thursday, in Ota, that the four died on their way to the hospital. He said 12 others sustained injuries. It was reported that the FRSC Sector Commander had said on Wednesday that nine persons died while 16 others sustained various degrees of injuries in the ghastly accident. He explained that the accident occurred at about 3.45 pm around Wichtech Company, near Danco Station, on the ever-busy expressway. He said that the accident involved a commercial white Mazda bus, with registration number: APP 28 YE, and a blue Volvo truck, with no registration number. The sector commander further stated that the accident involved 25 persons, indicating that the corpses of the deceased have been deposited at the morgue of Idera Hospital, Sagamu.

He advised motorists to exercise patience and remain calm, as the situation in the axis would soon be normalised.
