Gov. Darius Ishaku of Taraba on Tuesday sought the support of Northeast region governors on actualisation of the Mambilla Hydro Electric Power project for the benefit of the sub-region and the nation.  Ishaku spoke at the opening of the fifth meeting of the Northeast governors in Jalingo. The governor said the Mambilla power project was capable of transforming the economy of the sub-region and that of the country. He urged governors to push for a supplementary budget for the power project, saying it was surprising to hear of zero allocation for the project in the 2021 federal budget. Ishaku called on other governors to push for oil exploration in the Lake Chad Basin and Benue Trough for the sub-region to join other oil-producing regions. He said, if successful, the Northeast would equally benefit from the 13 per cent derivation being enjoyed by the Niger Delta region. Gov. Babagana Zulum of Borno and Chairman of the forum, noted that the essence of the meeting was to present a common front on the challenges facing the individual states with a view to overcoming them. Zulum commended President Muhammadu Buhari on the recent visit to Borno, saying the security situation had improved. The governor commended the troops over their renewed vigour in the fight against insurgency. “I want to urge troops to capitalise on the current division in the ranks of the insurgents and defeat them totally for a peaceful sub-region,” he said. It was reported that Gov. Bala Mohammed of Bauchi, Gov. Inua Yahaya of Gombe State, Gov. Umaru Fintiri of Adamawa and Idi Barde-Gubana, Deputy Governor of Yobe are attending the meeting.
