The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) on Saturday held its 2021 National Environmental Sanitation Day across all local government areas in Kano State.  Flagging off the exercise in Kano metropolis, the Director-General of the scheme, Brig.-Gen Shuaibu Ibrahim, said that environmental sanitation was recognised globally as one of the key requirements for prevention of diseases. Ibrahim, was represented by the Kano State Coordinator of NYSC, Hajiya Aisha Tata-Muhammad. He said that efforts must be stepped up to enlighten  the general public, especially rural dwellers on the health risks of poor hygiene. He described the theme of the programme, “Clean Environment/Good Hygiene: Panacea For Good Health and Long Life”, as apt and timely. According to him, to achieve this , every member of the community will have to be mobilised for participation in the exercise which would feature sensitisation, disease surveillance and report of outbreaks. “Indeed, a call to action will promote cooperation and reduce indifference and ignorance. A good example is seen in the robust response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with awareness,” he said. Ibrahim said that at  the recent nationwide medical outreaches conducted by NYSC Health Initiative for Rural Dwellers, most of the ailments diagnosed and treated were as a result of poor hygiene. “Efforts must be made to save many more lives by empowering the people with adequate information on good grooming and environmental hygiene,” he said. He thanked the state government, traditional rulers and community leaders for their support and assured Nigerians of NYSC’s commitment to offer health and other services, including environmental sanitation. Earlier, the Head of Community Development Service, Malam Bala Dabo, commended the scheme  for the efforts toward keeping the environment clean and healthy.
