A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State, Mrs Omowumi Olatunji-Ohwovoriole, says there are reasons for Muslim faithful in Nigeria to celebrate the 2021 Eid-el-Kabir, having survived all sorts of challenges bedeviling the country.  Olatunji-Ohwovoriole, who is the Chairman of the Governing Council of the Federal Polytechnic, Kaura-Namoda, Zamfara, stated this in a congratulatory message by her media aide, Mr Joe Ola, on Tuesday in Akure. She said that despite threatening issues facing the country, God has deemed it fit to keep it together. The APC stalwart, therefore, asked Muslims to celebrate in low key and in constant appreciation of the Almighty God. The chairman enjoined Muslims to adhere to all safety protocols as the world was again experiencing a third wave of COVID-19. “It is the duty of each and everyone to comply with and adhere strictly to prescribed protocols toward stemming the spread of the disease,” she warned. Olatunji-Ohwovoriole, who is also the founder of My Choice Group, expressed best wishes to Muslims most especially members of My Choice Group on the Eid-el-Kabir, saying the people should continue to show love to one another and remain in peace despite all beleaguered issues. She used the opportunity to thank the state governor, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, his wife, Betty, the state APC  Chairman, Mr Ade Adetimehin, for their support towards the actualisation of her dreams.
